# PsCushman-python-api-challenge

I received help in a few areas from LAs. 

First, I was having a little trouble setting up my url in the weather challenge. I worked with a LA to debug. Also, in the weather section, I asked a LA to help me define my function for the regressions. I was tring to loop instead of just setting up a function and adjusting for each graph.

In the Vaction section, I had some syntax issues with my bias and filter. I worked with a LA to debug that as well.
